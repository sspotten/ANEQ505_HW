Due: 04/09/2026

**For complete credit for this assignment, you must answer all questions and include all commands in your Obsidian upload.** 

------------------------------------------------------------------
**Learning Objectives**
1. Practice recording commands and editing code to match your analysis.
2. Create publication-ready figures for alpha and beta diversity.
3. Understand how to run ANCOM-BC2 and how to interpret the results. 
--------------------------------------------------

#### Cow Body Site - making figures in R

**Set up the cow R analysis file structure**
- Make a cow_r directory on your local computer, and inside the cow_r directory, make the following directories 
cow_r  
├── 01_notes  
├── 02_data  
├── 03_metadata  
├── 04_code  
└── 05_figures

- Inside the 04_code directory, make the following directories
04_code  
├── alpha_div 
├── beta_div 
├── taxonomy

- Download the cow_metadata.txt, shannon.tsv, unweighted_unifrac.txt, tabulated_results.tsv, and cow_HW4_r.Rmd files from Canvas and put them in the correct directories. 

**What directory should the cow_HW4_r.Rmd file go in? ~={red}(1 point)=~**

- *Write the directory here:* cow_r/04_code
#### Statistical analysis and figure generation in R 

- Now that we have set up the correct file structure and put our files in the correct directories, we can start our cow R analysis. 
- Open the cow_HW4_r.Rmd file and start working through the analysis.

**Note that if you open the markdown file in your Downloads, the working directory will not be correct. Make sure to only open the markdown file after you have put it in the correct working directory.**

**Read in metadata ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the metadata. 
```
metadata <- read_tsv("../03_metadata/cow_metadata.txt")
```

**Read in alpha diversity data ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the shannon data
```
shannon <- read_tsv("alpha_div/shannon.tsv")
```

**Read in beta diversity data ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the unweighted unifrac data
```
uw_unifrac <- read_tsv("beta_div/unweighted_unifrac.txt")
```

**Load in tabulated results ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the tabulated_results.tsv
```
tabulated_results <- read_tsv("taxonomy/tabulated_results.tsv")
```

#### Cow Body Site - ANCOM-BC2 in Qiime2
**Start an interactive session and activate Qiime2**
```
# Note that I added the --qos flag since Alpine complained without it
ainteractive --ntasks=4 --time=04:00:00 --qos=normal
```

- **ANCOMBC2 is only available in the 2026 versions of qiime2, so we need to activate the latest version. Make sure to activate qiime2026**
```
module purge
module load qiime2/2026.1_amplicon
```
(When running commands using qiime2/2026.1_amplicon you might get this warning: */curc/sw/install/bio/qiime2/2026.1/2026.1_amplicon_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/unifrac/__init__.py:9: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81. import pkg_resources*. This is just saying that one of the qiime2 packages needs to be updated it won't affect the qiime2 outputs.)


**Filter controls out of our table
```
# Get metadata with no controls--save to metadata folder
cp /pl/active/courses/2025_summer/CSU_2025/cow_hw/cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt .

cd ../dada2

qiime feature-table filter-samples \
--i-table table_nomitochloro_gg2_filtered300.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata/cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt \
--o-filtered-table table_nomitochlorocontrols_gg2_filtered300.qza
```

**Filter Samples ~={red}(1 point)=~** 
- Navigate into the cow tutorial and make a new ancombc2 directory for the ANCOM-BC2 analysis
- Navigate into the ancombc2 directory
- Choose the min frequency for sample filtering:
```
qiime feature-table filter-samples \
--i-table ../dada2/table_nomitochlorocontrols_gg2_filtered300.qza \
--p-min-frequency 5000 \
--o-filtered-table table_5k.qza
```

**Filter out low abundance and low prevalence ASVs ~={red}(1 point)=~**

```
qiime feature-table filter-features \
--i-table table_5k.qza \
--p-min-frequency 50 \
--p-min-samples 20 \
--o-filtered-table table_5k_abund.qza
```

**Collapse features to genus level ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- We will collapse to the genus level to make it easier to interpret the results. (Hint: We used 7 for species, so think about which number you would use for genus.)

```
qiime taxa collapse \
--i-table table_5k_abund.qza \
--i-taxonomy ../taxonomy/taxonomy_gg2_filtered.qza \
--p-level 6 \
--o-collapsed-table table_5k_abund_6.qza
```


**Run ANCOM-BC2 ~={red}(1 point)=~**

```
qiime composition ancombc2 \
--i-table table_5k_abund_6.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata/cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt \
--p-fixed-effects-formula body_site \
--o-ancombc2-output ancombc2_results_bodysite_genus.qza
```


**Visualize the ANCOM-BC2 results ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Generate a barplot to visualize the differentially abundant features. 
```
qiime composition tabulate \
--i-data ancombc2_results_bodysite_genus.qza \
--o-visualization ancombc2_bodysite_genus.qzv
  
qiime composition ancombc2-visualizer \
  --i-data ancombc2_results_bodysite_genus.qza \
  --o-visualization ancombc2_barplot_bodysite_genus.qzv
```

## Homework questions: (~={red}5 POINTS=~)
1. Describe one way to get data from your qiime2 outputs into a format that can be used for R.
	1. 

2. Which body site appeared most distinct in the taxa bar plot, meaning it was not similar to at least one of the other body sites? Explain why that site looks different.
	1. The fecal samples appeared most distinct in the taxa bar plot. This makes sense since the fecal samples have come through the gut, where many different microbes live that don't occur in the other body sites, which are external to the animal.

3. When generating the filtered table for ANCOM-BC2, what value did you choose for `--p-min-frequency`? Which core metrics parameter should this match, and why do these values need to be the same? (Report your core metrics value here: **5000**)
	1. We want the sampling depth of the samples in the filtered table for ANCOM-BC2 to match the sampling depth (rarefaction depth) we chose in rarefying for core diversity metrics (--p-sampling-depth 5000). We want to be consistent in our sampling depth across analyses and use the same samples for both core metrics and ANCOM-BC2, because including the low-depth samples in the latter can introduce noise that might bias our interpretation of diversity and differential abundance between sample types.

4. Why do we filter out samples with low frequency and low abundance ASVs?
	1. In the case of both, it is to reduce bias. Filtering out samples with low frequency (sampling depth) is addressed in question 3. Filtering out low-abundance ASVs is also important because at low frequencies, it is difficult to separate signal from noise. Is an ASV that is only represented a handful of times real signal, or an artifact of some kind (contamination, PCR error, a result of the stochastic sampling error and <100% efficiency inherent to PCR, etc.)? If we leave low-abundance ASVs in the dataset, they could bias our diversity and our differential abundance results.

5. What was the most enriched genus in skin compared to fecal, and what was the most depleted genus in skin compared to fecal (make sure adjusted p is set to less than 0.05)?
	1. The most enriched genus in skin compared to fecal samples was **Atopostipes**. The most depleted genus in skin compared to fecal samples was **Streptococcus**.

### **Questions:**
1. Why might removing controls be important before downstream analysis?
	1. We don't want the ML classifier to learn patterns (if any) in control samples, because control samples will not add meaningful information to the model at best, or degrade the model's performance at worst. In other words, we don't care if the model can distinguish controls from other samples, we care if it can reliably distinguish between different cow body sites, which is our biological question.
2. what 2 features that are high in fecal samples?
	1. The two features that are high in fecal samples are the species **Cryptobacteroides sp902787255** and **Faecousia sp000434635**.
3. what are 2 features that are low in nasal?
	1. It's hard to tell by the heatmap, but if I'm interpreting the colors correctly, aside from several taxa that appear to be at a log10 frequency of 0, but the genus **Parabacteroides_B_862066** and genus **Ruoffia** are the two lowest taxa in the nasal sample group.
4. what is the accuracy of your model, and if the accuracy of the classifier is high, what does that suggest about the microbial compositions of each site?
	1. The baseline accuracy of the classifier is 88% (0.882353) and the micro-average AUC is 0.99, which is very good. (So good, in fact, that I start to suspect overtraining; i.e. has it learned the patterns of this particular dataset a little too well, such that it would perform poorly on a new dataset?) The only samples that are getting confused with each other some of the time are the skin and udder samples, which makes sense given how similar they are in composition, as seen in previous analyses. Fecal, nasal, and oral samples are getting predicted as the correct class 100% of the time. This suggests that the microbial communities in each body site are consistently quite different from each other, such that it is very easy to identify them based on their composition.
